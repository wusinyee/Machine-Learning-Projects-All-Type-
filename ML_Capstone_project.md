Machine Learning Capstone PPT Project

Capstone Project: Final Task
The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation based on the
outcomes of all tasks in previous modules and labs.
Your presentation will develop into a story of all your machine learning journey in this project, and it should be compelling and easy to understand.
In the next exercise, you can find a provided PowerPoint template to help you get started to
create a report in slides format. There are placeholders in the template for each of the required elements of the project,
and that instructions are provided on each slide. You need to delete and replace the placeholders with the actual content.
However, you are encouraged to add additional elements such as slides, charts, and tables.
There are a total of 70 points possible points for the final assessment,
and you will be graded by your peers, who are also completing this assignment.
The main grading criteria will be:
•	Uploaded your completed presentation in PDF format (2 pts)
•	Completed the required Introduction slide (4 pt)
•	Completed the required Exploratory Data Analysis slides (8 pts)
•	Completed the required content-based recommender system using user profile and course genres slides (6 pts)
•	Completed the required content-based recommender system using course similarity slides (6 pts)
•	Completed the required content-based recommender system using user profile clustering slides (6 pts)
•	Completed the required KNN-based collaborative filtering slide (6 pts)
•	Completed the required NMF-based collaborative filtering slide (6 pts)
•	Completed the required neural network embedding based collaborative filtering slide (6 pts)
•	Completed the required collaborative filtering algorithms evaluation slides (6 pts)
•	Completed the required Conclusion slide (6 pts)
•	Applied your creativity to improve the presentation beyond the template (4 pts)
•	Displayed any innovative insights (4 pts)
You may find more instructions in the PPT template. Also, you will
not be judged on your English language, including spelling, or grammatical mistakes.

Let me help you create a detailed outline for each section of the presentation based on the template:

1. Title Slide:
```
Build a Personalized Online Course Recommender System with Machine Learning
[Your Name]
[Current Date]
```

2. Introduction:
- Background: Growing need for personalized online learning
- Context: Large course catalog requires intelligent recommendations
- Problem Statement: Help learners find relevant courses efficiently
- Hypothesis: Machine learning can improve course recommendations through:
  * Content-based filtering
  * Collaborative filtering
  * Neural network approaches

3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Course Genre Distribution:
  * Bar chart showing course counts per category
  * Identify dominant genres and gaps

- Enrollment Patterns:
  * Histogram of user enrollment counts 
  * Analysis of learning behaviors

- Popular Courses:
  * Top 20 most enrolled courses
  * Patterns in popular content

- Course Title Analysis:
  * Word cloud visualization
  * Common themes and topics

4. Content-based Recommender Systems:
a) User Profile & Course Genres:
- Flowchart showing:
  * Data preprocessing
  * Feature extraction
  * Profile creation
  * Recommendation generation
- Evaluation metrics:
  * Top 10 recommended courses
  * Average new recommendations per user
  * Performance parameters

b) Course Similarity:
- Implementation flowchart
- Similarity metrics
- Results analysis
- Hyperparameter optimization

c) User Profile Clustering:
- Clustering methodology
- Implementation flow
- Cluster analysis
- Recommendation results

5. Collaborative Filtering:
- KNN Implementation:

  * Embedding visualization

6. Performance Comparison:
- Bar chart comparing RMSE across models
- Analysis of strengths/weaknesses
- Best performing approach

7. Conclusions:
- Summary of findings
- Most effective approaches
- Recommendations for implementation
- Future improvements

8. Appendix:
- GitHub repository link
- Key code snippets
- Additional visualizations
- Streamlit app demo (if created)

Remember to:
- Include clear visualizations
- Add explanatory notes
- Show implementation details
